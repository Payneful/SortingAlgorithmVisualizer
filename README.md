# Overview

I wanted to visually see what was happening with the sorts and how they are changing to get to the end result of it being in order and how long it too to get there. By doing this it helped me more understand a couple different sorts and how much of a difference it makes when you ensure you are working with the fastest algorithms you can.

# Development Environment

I created this using python as my language and visual studio code for my ide. I also used some sorting agorithms from NeuralNine's video to add more algorithms in my testing. I created the graphs using Matplotlib and importing time to use the time.perf_counter() for timings.

# Future Work

* add more sorting alorithms for plotting
* Show multiple graphs at one time
* Figure out how to make it go faster or use other graphs if not
